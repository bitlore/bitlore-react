					<h3>Our mission</h3>
					<p>An old friend of mine. Well, enemy. The stuff of nightmares reduced to an exhibit. I'm getting old. Do you wanna come with me? 'Cause if you do, then I should warn you â€” you're gonna see all sorts of things. Ghosts from the past. Aliens from the future. The day the Earth died in a ball of flame. It won't be quiet, it won't be safe, and it won't be calm. But I'll tell you what it will be: The trip of a lifetime! You look beautiful! ...considering. That you're human.</p>
					<p><i>I think you need a doctor.</i></p>

								There's something that doesn't make sense. Let's go and poke it with a stick. Look at me, no plans, no backup, no weapons worth a damn. Oh, and something else I don't have: anything to lose. So, if you're sitting up there with your silly little spaceships and your silly little guns; just remember who's standing in your way. Remember every black day I ever stopped you and then, and then, do the smart thing. Let somebody else try first.

								Sweet, maybe...Passionate, I suppose...But don't ever mistake that for nice. Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh...Black tie...whenever I wear this, something bad always happens. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors!
